📘 # C# Fundementals
================================

🔢 Variables :
 are used to store data that can change during the execution of a program. In C#, every variable has a specific data type that defines the kind of data it can hold, such as numbers, text, or true/false values.

---------------------------------------
📚 Data Types :
C# supports different data types to handle various kinds of data. Common types include integers, floating-point numbers, characters, strings, and booleans. Understanding data types is essential for using variables correctly and safely.

---------------------------------------

➕ Math Operators:
 are used to perform arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus. These are essential for calculations in programs.

--------------------------------------------
🔁 Increment and Decrement:
These operators are used to increase or decrease a numeric variable by one. The increment operator (++) adds one, while the decrement operator (--) subtracts one. They can be used in pre- or post-form.

-----------------------------------------------
🔀 Conditions:
Conditional statements allow a program to make decisions based on certain conditions. Common constructs include if, else if, else, and switch, enabling logic that adapts to different situations.

--------------------------------------------
🔄 Loops:
are used to repeat actions multiple times. C# provides several loop types, including for, while, and do-while. They are useful for iterating through data or repeating a block of code until a condition is met.

---------------------------------------------
🧮 Functions:
 (also called methods) are blocks of code that perform a specific task. They can take inputs (parameters), return values, and help organize and reuse code efficiently. Functions can be simple or complex and are fundamental to structured programming.

-----------------------------------------------

🧵 Delegates :
 are special objects that can hold references to methods. They allow methods to be passed as parameters and enable event-driven programming and callbacks. Delegates support encapsulation of method calls and are a foundation for events and LINQ.

-------------------------------------------

🧱 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
OOP is a programming approach based on the concept of objects, which combine data and behavior. C# supports OOP through four main principles:

Encapsulation: Bundles data and methods inside a class and hides internal details.

Inheritance: Allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class.

Polymorphism: Enables one interface to be used with different underlying forms (e.g., method overriding).

Abstraction: Hides complex implementation details and shows only the necessary features.

---------------------------------------------
🔒 Access Modifiers:
 control the visibility of classes, methods, and variables. Common modifiers include:

public: Accessible from anywhere.

private: Accessible only within the same class.

protected: Accessible within the same class and subclasses.

internal: Accessible within the same assembly/project.

protected internal: Accessible from the same assembly or any subclass.

private protected: Accessible from the same class or subclass within the same assembly.
